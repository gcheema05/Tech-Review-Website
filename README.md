<p>
A desktop-optimized HTML/CSS website designed to provide engaging and structured reviews of popular tech products. This project showcases strong layout design, semantic structuring, and static interactivity across multiple linked pages.

<h2>📌 Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
Many tech review sites overload users with cluttered content and poor user experience. This project aims to create a clean, structured, and aesthetically pleasing review website using only <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>—optimized for desktop viewing.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>✅ Solution</h2>
<p>
This static website includes four well-structured HTML pages with easy navigation and consistent styling:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Home Page (home.html)</strong> – Overview of the site, types of tech reviewed, a summary of featured articles with buttons to read full reviews, an explanation of the review process using a table, and a "Why Choose Us" section with 3 highlights.</li>
  <li><strong>Phones (one.html)</strong> – A detailed review of the iPhone 15 with a summary table acting as a review scoreboard.</li>
  <li><strong>Video Games (two.html)</strong> – A detailed review of Fortnite Battle Royale, also using a scoreboard table format.</li>
  <li><strong>Contact Us Page (three.html)</strong> – A basic contact form where users can input their email, phone number, and a message.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The site is styled using clean, custom CSS for layout, colors, typography, and spacing. Navigation is enabled between all pages for a seamless experience.
