          Welcome to TechBeamReviews, where we bring you beaming tech-related reviews and serve as your go-to guide for anything tech.

                One of the reviews we recently covered on our website was the new base model, iPhone 15. For our testing, we had a black 128GB variant, but the base model iPhone can bumped up to 256GB or 512GB, and there are various colours to choose from, such as Green, Yellow, Pink, and Blue.

              <p>
                One of the video games we reviewed recently on our website was Fortnite Battle Royale to see just how well the worldwide sensation is holding up. With the initial launch of the Fortnite Battle Royale platform in 2017, the game has evolved over the years. Some say it's for the better, but some say Fortnite has lost its initial purpose and feel that made it a worldwide sensation.

        <h1>Our Approach</h1>
        <p>
          At TechBeamReviews, we take a different approach than most reviewers. We emphasise the product experience over specs and numbers. While we do discuss the specifications, we aim to keep it simple so that just about anyone can read our review and gain valuable insights. To see the exact process for our reviews, you can check out our scorecards below!

            <td>
              Like other rivals in the same price range, the design is cutting-edge and elegantly styled. However, there are no design elements to set it apart from others.

              The software is well-designed and relatively easy to use compared to its peers. However, the hardware side could require time to get used to since the volume buttons and the power button are on the same side rather than separate sides.

            <td>
              The phone feels snappy and smooth in nearly every application, whether that be intensive or day-to-day tasks. Overall, the phone has excellent performance and outperforms most of its peers.

            </td>
            <td>
              The battery life is the biggest weakness, lasting only ¾ of the day with some heavy usage before dying and needing to be charged again. However, it does have decent fast charging that allows the phone to reach 50% within 30 minutes.

            </td>
            <td>
              The camera is on par with its peers in terms of hardware, but where it follows short compared to its peers is on the software side. Sometimes images and videos look great, but other times not so much, as such consistency is the weakness of the cameras.

              The graphics are unique. Unlike most games, the game has comic book-like graphics, while most other games try to have graphics that are as close to reality as possible.

              One of the main selling points of the game is its storyline. The action-packed storyline pulls you in and keeps you hooked till the end with various emotional and hype moments.
