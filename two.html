        <h3>Graphics</h3>
        <p>
          Over the years, Fortnite Battle Royale has evolved significantly in terms of graphics. In 2022, the game transitioned to Unreal Engine 5.1, showcasing improved fidelity and enhanced visuals, which not only enhanced the game but also brought a more immersive experience, making every battle and landscape come to life in stunning detail. Most other battle royale games don’t focus too much on the graphics side of things, but Fortnite differentiates itself from the crowd. As such, for a battle royale game, Fortnite has excellent graphics.

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
          Fortnite Battle Royale offers an engaging and dynamic gameplay experience that has allowed it to become the worldwide sensation it is today. Its fast-paced action, unique building mechanics, and constant updates through seasons and chapters have improved the gameplay even further. However, due to the regular updates and changes, the game that once was a simple battle royale game with new players who did not know how to use the building mechanics within the game no longer exists. As a result, Fortnite has faced a lot of backlash from older players who played the game since 2017, but the fact is that even now, Fortnite has excellent gameplay. I would even dare to say that it has improved over the years.

        <h3>Controls</h3>
        <p>
          The controls in Fortnite Battle Royale are quick to learn and easy to use, making for an excellent gaming experience for users. Additionally, the controls are well-suited to every platform, so you will know that you will have a great time no matter the platform you choose. Not only does it provide great controls for all platforms, but it also allows players to customise the controls in the game to suit their preferences and playing style thanks to its adjustable options. Furthermore, Fortnite's exclusive building mechanisms are simple to understand yet provide a high skill ceiling for players who want to learn more complex strategies. Overall, the controls help make the game more playable, and Fortnite continues to improve controls over the years.

        <h3>Replay Value</h3>
        <p>
          To keep things short, Fortnite Battle Royale has excellent replay value. Due to the nature of the game, which is to eliminate all 99 other players and be the last one standing, you find yourself wanting to play just one more game and another one, eventually finding yourself playing for many hours to get a win. Overall, Fortnite Battle Royale has excellent replay value and will keep you entertained for hours.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          In conclusion, Fortnite Battle Royale, although changed, is still an excellent game and one of a kind in its class of games. It provides outstanding graphics and replay value while providing unique controls and gameplay, such as the building mechanics, a defining feature of Fortnite Battle Royale. I believe it is a game that anyone can play and will enjoy, but if you are uncertain, you can look at the scoreboard below and form your opinion.
