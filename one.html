        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>
          In terms of design, the iPhone 15 does not differ much from the previous generation, the iPhone 14. Nor does it include some never seen before design. However, some new design aspects are different from the iPhone 14, like the Dynamic Island (the pill-shaped cutout for the front camera and Face ID sensors) that was only a part of the Pro model phones for the last generation. The new iPhone 15 is available in black, pink, yellow, green, and blue. For our review, we looked at a black iPhone 15, and I must say, if you're going for stealth, then you have to go with the black iPhone 15. Overall, it's a tried and trusted design, and the new Dynamic Island does help differentiate it from the previous generation.

        <h3>Ease of Use</h3>
        <p>
          Like all Apple products, the iPhone 15 is easy to use and navigate for just about anyone. During our testing, we found the phone to be relatively intuitive. Even with the introduction of iOS 17, the new iOS update that the iPhone 15 shipped out with, the iPhone felt the same as any other iPhone from previous generations. However, with iOS 17 came many new features, which may take some time to get used to, such as the new NameDrop feature, which allows you to swap contact info with another iPhone user (running iOS 17) by just tapping your phones together. Although it takes time to get used to these new features, they are helpful and intuitive. In conclusion, the iPhone 15 is easy to use and provides various new features to support your experience.

        </div>
        <h3>Display</h3>
        <p>
          The iPhone 15 features a 6.1” Super Retina XDR display. Unlike the iPhone 15 Pro, the base model 15 does not have the ProMotion technology, which allows for a 120HZ refresh rate or simply smoother animations, nor does it have the Always-On display. Although the exclusiveness of the ProMotion feature makes sense, it would have been nice to see the Always-On display make its way to the base model iPhone 15. Nevertheless, the 6.1” Super Retina XDR display of the iPhone 15 is great. It looks great outdoors and indoors with sharp colours and excellent brightness.

        </div>
        <h3>Performance</h3>
        <p>
          In terms of performance, the iPhone 15 features the A16 Bionic Chip, an upgrade from the A15 Bionic Chip found in the previous generation, iPhone 14. In fact, according to Apple, the A16 GPU (graphic processing unit) is up to 40% faster than the iPhone 12 and its GPU. In real-life applications, the iPhone 15 is a bit snappier and smoother than previous generations, but the difference is not a lot unless you push the phone to its limits. In general, the iPhone 15’s improvement in the performance category will help prevent slow down and allow for updates for many years.

        <h3>Battery</h3>
        <p>
          The battery life of the new iPhone 15 is excellent, and in our testing, we found Apple's claim of all-day battery life to be accurate. For our test, we did some light tasks, such as emailing or messaging a friend, and some heavier tasks, such as streaming some content. Though battery life is excellent, the main selling point of the iPhone 15 in terms of its battery would be the change of the charging port from Lighting to USB-C, which allows for faster charging with the 20W USB-C Power Adapter (sold separately). Overall, the battery life of the new iPhone 15 is excellent, and with the all-new USB-C connector, you will have even faster charging times.

        <h3>Camera Quality</h3>
        <p>
          The camera quality of the iPhone 15 is stunning and impressive. It does an excellent job in both dark and bright lighting. However, the main point of the iPhone 15 and its camera would be the all-new 48MP camera, which is a new feature to the whole lineup of new generation iPhones. A higher megapixel camera is great for the newer generation of iPhones because it means higher resolution pictures and allows greater detail. Overall, it's nice to see that even the base model iPhone 15 got the new camera update, which I believe will continue to improve with newer software updates, but even now, the photos from the iPhone 15 are great.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          In conclusion, if you want to upgrade from the iPhone 13 or 14 to the new base model iPhone 15, I would say to wait for the next generation because the iPhone 15 is not much different from the last two generations. However, if you want to upgrade from iPhone 12 and below, I believe it's a great time to upgrade your phone. The iPhone 15 is a phone that has an excellent design, usability, display, performance, battery, and camera. However, if unsure, you can use our scoreboard below to formulate your opinion on the iPhone 15.

              The iPhone 15 looks much like the iPhone 14, but the new Dynamic Island for the front camera sets it apart. We checked out the black one, and it's pretty sleek. It's still the classic iPhone style we know.
